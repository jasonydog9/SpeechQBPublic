This project allows people QuizBowl players to study QuizBowl using an AI voice reader in voice and message channels. SpeechQB uses two APIs, one to get the questions first (https://www.qbreader.org/) and one to get an audio file of the text (Google TTS). A player can type in the command -play [categories] [difficulties] to start a reading session, i. e -play geo 2, geo being geography. The process of starting a session goes like this: a user types in the command to start the session, SpeechQB will join the voice channel, SpeechQB will
make an API call to https://www.qbreader.org/ to retrieve a question, SpeechQB will then make another API call to Google TTS to turn the question text into a playable audio file, then SpeechQB will play the audio file. Once it starts playing the user is free to buzz in by typing "bz" or "buzz"
